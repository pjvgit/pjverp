                <p><b>TERMS OF SERVICE</b></p>

                <p>You agree that you will not misuse the Portal. Misuse can take many forms, including, but not limited to, using the Portal in a manner that violates applicable federal, state or local laws or regulations; trying to gain access to other users’ accounts within the Portal; attempting to engage or engaging in fraud or other illegal activity; scraping, monitoring, or copying any of the material in the Portal that is not your information; or attacking, impairing, or interfering with the Portal. </p>

                <p>If using a mobile device to access the Portal, data charges may apply, which you are solely responsible for.  Such charges include those from your communications service provider.

                <p><b>3. e-Notices and System Requirements</b>. As a condition to your use of the Portal, including the Payment Service (described below), you agree to accept in electronic form all notices, communications, disclosures, and records regarding the Payment Service or otherwise related to your use of the Portal (“e-Notices”).  To receive e-Notices you warrant (promise) that you have all of the following system requirements, which are required to access, view, download, and retain e-Notices:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li style="list-style-type:none;"> i. A computer or mobile device with Internet or mobile connectivity</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type:none;"> ii. Up-to-date Internet browsers on Windows 8 and higher, macOS 10.13 and higher, iOS 12 and higher, or Android 6 and higher operating systems.

                    <li style="list-style-type:none;"> iii. Access to the email address used to register for your Portal account.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type:none;"> iv. Sufficient storage space to save e-Notices and/or a printer to print them. You should maintain a paper copy for your records. Other than as is required by applicable law, we will not provide or make your records available to you on paper or in nonelectronic form.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>You may withdraw consent to receive e-Notices by contacting the law firm you are working with or emailing us at support@mycase.com. A withdrawal of consent to receive e-Notices will result in the termination of our relationship with you, including your right to access and use the Portal. Such termination, however, will not relieve you from any obligations or responsibilities you have to us at the time of termination, including payment for any services we have provided, or impact any obligations you have under any other agreements, such as those with your law firm or bank.</p>
                
                <p>We will send e-Notices to the address you identified when registering for your Portal account. If your email address changes or becomes disabled, you must notify us immediately by updating your email address in the Portal. You understand and agree we may send e-Notices to your designated email address whether or not that address includes a designation for delivery to the attention of any particular person and whether or not anyone other than you is able to access and/or read emails sent to your designated email address.</p>

                <p><b>4. Payment Services</b>. Subject to your compliance with all of the terms and conditions in these Terms of Service, you may use the Portal to view charges and authorize one-time electronic payments (the “Payment Service”) on the engagement agreement you have with your law firm (your “Payment Agreement”).</p>
                
                <p>You understand and agree that regardless of the payment amount or payment effective date you schedule using the Portal, you are responsible for complying with all of the terms and conditions of your Payment Agreement, including, without limitation, your agreement to make all payments when due and in the amount required by your Payment Agreement.</p>
                
                <p>To use the Payment Service, you must provide a bank account or credit card to your account within the Portal (each,  a “Payment Form”). When you add a Payment Form and schedule a one-time electronic payment from that Payment Form, you authorize us to debit (take) electronic payment(s) from that Payment Form as scheduled. You warrant (promise) that you have the authority to authorize us to debit or, as applicable, charge of the scheduled payment(s) from the Payment Form you have picked.</p>
                
                <p>You understand and agree that if you authorize a one-time electronic payment using the Payment Service, that payment will be processed (except if cancelled in a timely fashion in accordance with applicable law) even if your account with your law firm is prepaid at the time of processing or the payment results in a prepayment of your account with your law firm. You may contact your law firm if you need assistance in determining whether prepayment of your account benefits you.</p>
                
                <p>If paying via bank transfer, funds must be available in the linked bank account when an electronic payment is processed against that account. If a scheduled online payment fails because the linked bank account contains insufficient funds to satisfy the entire amount of your scheduled payment, you are not relieved of your responsibility to timely pay any amount then due in accordance with the terms and conditions of your Payment Agreement and any penalties imposed by your bank for insufficient funds.</p>
                
                <p>If paying via credit card, you may be entitled to dispute a transaction, also known as a chargeback. If a scheduled online payment is reversed because of a chargeback, you are not relieved of your responsibility to timely pay any amount then due in accordance with the terms and conditions of your Payment Agreement and any penalties imposed by your financial institution.</p>
                
                <p>You are not permitted to affect, change, revoke or terminate a one-time electronic payment if that payment is in process, except as permitted by law. This means, among other things, that if you or we terminate your online payments, that termination will not revoke or terminate any payment that is in process  A payment is “in process” on the post date of the payment.</p>
                
                <p>You also may have the legal right to revoke electronic payments by contacting the financial institution that holds your linked bank account or issued your credit card. Contact your financial institution to determine the information your financial institution needs to process your revocation and the time your financial institution needs to process any revocation.</p>
                
                <p>We may terminate or suspend your use of the Payment Service or Portal at any time in our sole discretion. If we so terminate, you remain responsible to make timely payments under the Payment Agreement.</p>
                
                <p>Nothing in this paragraph relieves you of your responsibility to pay any amount, fee or charge you may owe under your Payment Agreement. Also, you will be responsible for paying any amount you may owe other persons or companies related to the use of the Payment Service or any bank account or credit card linked to online payments. For example, a bank may charge a fee in connection with electronic payments debited to (taken from) a bank account you use to make a payment through the Portal.</p>
                

                <p><b>5. Third Party Services</b>. The Portal may contain links to other websites, services, and products provided by third parties, which may include our affiliates or subsidiaries. Such links are provided for your convenience only. We have no control over such third-party websites, services, and products and accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third party websites or services found within the Portal, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites, services, or products.</p>
                            
                <p><b>6. Changes to the Portal</b>. We reserve the right to make changes to the Portal at any time.  You acknowledge and agree that we may add or remove functionalities, including without limitation, the Payment Service, or may stop supporting or making the Portal available altogether.  If required by applicable law, we will provide you with electronic notice of such changes.</p>
                
                <p><b>7. Security</b>. When using the Portal you may be asked from time to time to provide certain information for purposes of providing you services.

NEITHER US NOR ANY PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH US MAKES ANY COMMITMENT OR PROMISE WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURITY, RELIABILITY, QUALITY, ACCURACY OR AVAILABILITY OF THE PORTAL, OR THAT YOUR USE OF THE PORTAL WILL NOT RESULT IN EXPOSURE TO VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT THE PORTAL OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE PORTAL WILL OTHERWISE MEET YOUR NEEDS.</b></p>
                
                <p><b>EXCEPT FOR ANY WARRANTIES WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE PORTAL, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</b></p>

                <p><b>11. Indemnification</b>. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless us and our affiliates, licensors, and third party service providers, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Service or your use of the Portal.</p>
                
                <p>You will not be responsible for indemnifying us or holding us harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses caused solely by or solely arising out of the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of MyCase, or its agents, officers, employees or affiliates.</p>
                
                <p><b>12. Arbitration Agreement</b>. You and we each agrees that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and us in connection with these Terms of Service or the Portal, including without limitation, federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.</p>
                
                <p>You and we agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator(s) may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator(s) may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other persons or parties.</p>
                
                <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, the arbitrator(s) can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. The arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator(s) to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate, or the interpretation of the prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized relief provisions above, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>
                
                <p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other party, by certified mail, a completed Notice of Dispute. You should send this notice to us at: MyCase, Inc., 9201 Spectrum Center Blvd., Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92123, Attn: Legal. We will send any notice to you to the address associated with your account; it is your responsibility to keep your address up to date. All information called for in the notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.</p>
                
                <p>If you and we are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s website at www.adr.org.</p>
                
                <p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or we may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator(s) require otherwise. Any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator(s).</p>
                
                <p>The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different MyCase users, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving you to the extent required by applicable law. The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
                
                <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by us should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, we will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator(s) deem necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator(s) determine the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by us on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.</p>
                
                <p>With the exception of any of the prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized relief provisions above, if a court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this agreement to arbitrate shall still apply. If a court decides that any of the prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized relief provisions above is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in court. All other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of this agreement to arbitrate shall be arbitrated under its terms.</p>
                
                <p>If you are a new customer, you can choose to reject this agreement to arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice. The opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept these Terms of Service for the first time. You must mail the opt-out notice to MyCase, Inc., 9201 Spectrum Center Blvd., Suite 100, San Diego, CA 92123, Attn: Legal. The opt-out notice must include your name, address, phone number, and email address(es) used to log in to your account. You must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, all other terms of these Terms of Service will continue to apply. Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.</p>
                
                <p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this agreement to arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by this agreement to arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and us.</p>
        
                <p><b>13. Governing Law</b>. All claims arising out of or relating to the Portal, these Terms of Service, or the Payment Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, except any conflict of laws provisions.</p>

Your continued use of the Portal after any change(s) to these Terms of Service constitutes your consent to be bound by such change(s), so please check back here regularly.</p>

                <p>If you do not comply with these Terms of Service and we do not take action right away, it shall not be deemed a continuing or further waiver of your failure to comply.  Likewise, our failure to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

                <p>If it turns out that a particular provision or part of these Terms of Service is not enforceable, it will not affect any other terms.</p>

                <p>These Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Portal and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Portal.</p>
